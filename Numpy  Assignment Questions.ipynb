    "Increased Efficiency:\n",
    "By utilizing libraries, developers can leverage optimized algorithms and functionalities, leading to more efficient and faster development.\n",

    "In Python lists, elements can be of different data types, while NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements in the array must be of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance:\n",
    "NumPy arrays are more efficient in terms of memory usage and computation speed compared to Python lists, especially when dealing with large datasets. This is because NumPy arrays are implemented in C and optimized for numerical operations.\n",
